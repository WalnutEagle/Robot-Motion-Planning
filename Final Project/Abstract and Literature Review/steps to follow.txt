Creating an entire project based on the abstract you've provided is a complex task that involves several steps and requires a deep understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning, robotics, and programming in MATLAB. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you would need to take to create such a project:

1. Literature Review: Before starting the project, you would need to conduct a thorough literature review to understand the current state of research in path planning in stochastic environments and Deep Q-Learning.

2. Simulation Environment Setup: You would need to set up a simulation environment that can model stochastic environments. This could be done using a tool like MATLAB's Robotics System Toolbox or a custom simulation environment that you create.

3. Deep Q-Learning Algorithm Implementation: Implement the Deep Q-Learning algorithm in MATLAB. This involves creating a neural network model for the Q-function and defining the learning process, including the exploration strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy), the reward function, and the update rule.

4. Robot Model and Sensors: Define the robot model and its sensors within the simulation. This includes the robot's kinematics, dynamics, and the types of sensors it uses to perceive its environment (e.g., LIDAR, camera, etc.).

5. Stochastic Environment Modeling: Model the stochastic elements of the environment. This could include dynamic obstacles, changing terrain, and other unpredictable elements that the robot might encounter.

6. Training Process: Train the Deep Q-Learning model within the simulation. This involves running numerous episodes where the robot tries to reach its goal while the algorithm learns the optimal policy.

7. Evaluation and Comparison: After training, evaluate the performance of the robotic agent in various simulated stochastic environments. Compare its performance against traditional path planning algorithms based on efficiency, adaptability, and computational resources.

8. Optimization and Testing: Optimize the algorithm and test the robotic agent under different conditions to ensure robustness and reliability.

9. Documentation and Reporting: Document the entire process, including the algorithm details, simulation setup, training process, evaluation metrics, and results.

10. Code Refinement: Refine the code for efficiency and readability. Ensure that the code is well-commented and follows best practices.

For a project of this scale, you would typically need a team of people with expertise in machine learning, robotics, and software development, and it could take several months to complete. If you're looking to start this project, you should begin by breaking down each of these steps into smaller, manageable tasks and then proceed step by step. If you need specific help with any of these steps, such as understanding certain concepts or implementing specific parts of the code, feel free to ask!
