The challenge of robotic path planning in stochastic environments has gathered attention due to its relevance in real-world applications where unpredictability is a constant (LaValle, 2006). The integration of Deep Q-Learning into this field represents a convergence of reinforcement learning with robotic autonomy (Mnih et al., 2015). The influencing work by Mnih et al. (2015) on Deep Q-Networks (DQN) has laid the groundwork for subsequent research in applying deep learning to control policies. However, the stochastic nature of real-world environments necessitates an adaptive approach that can handle uncertainty and dynamic changes, a topic that has been explored to a lesser extent.
Kober et al. (2013) have discussed the potential of reinforcement learning in robotics, emphasizing the need for algorithms that can adapt to changing conditions. The application of Deep Q-Learning to stochastic environments requires the algorithm to manage a larger state space and make decisions with incomplete information which is a significant departure from the static worlds assumed by many path planning algorithms. The work by Silver et al. (2016) on mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search has implications for path planning, suggesting that the combination of deep learning with traditional planning methods can yield robust decision-making tools. This approach may be adapted to the stochastic path planning problem by incorporating uncertainty directly into the learning process as suggested by Osband et al. (2016) by whom bootstrapped DQN was introduced to enhance exploration.
