In order to obtain the results open the main_results.m in MATLAB online and main_results.py
in google colab respectively and simply click on run button. In case of main_results.m as it
is reinforcement learning and the steps I have submitted are small number of steps and episodes
if in Testing episodes it does not reach goal: RE RUN the main_results.m file once or twice
in order to get enough simulation episodes and the robot will start reaching the goal in testing
episodes. No need of additional libraries to be added for execution.
